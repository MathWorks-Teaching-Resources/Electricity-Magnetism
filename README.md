# Information

This curriculum module contains interactive [MATLAB® live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/live-editor.html) that provides supplementary examples and visualizations to enhance understanding of electricity and magnetism principles, specifically focusing on common application like capacitors and DC motors.

<a id="H_F00D98E4"></a>

## Background

These live scripts can be used as demonstrations in lectures, class activities, or interactive assignments outside class. This module covers electric fields and charge, magnetic fields and current, and the governing physical equations of electricity and magnetism. It also includes examples of applications like DC motors, capacitors, and magnetic braking.


The instructions inside the live scripts will guide you through the exercises and activities. Get started with each live script by running it one section at a time. To stop running the script or a section midway (for example, when an animation is in progress), use the <img src="Images/image_0.png" width="19" alt="image_0.png"> Stop button in the **RUN** section of the **Live Editor** tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.

## Getting Started
### Accessing the Module
### **On MATLAB Online:**

Use the [<img src="Images/image_1.png" width="136" alt="image_1.png">](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/emag&project=emag.prj) link to download the module. You will be prompted to log in or create a MathWorks account. The project will be loaded, and you will see an app with several navigation options to get you started.

### **On Desktop:**

Download or clone this repository. Open MATLAB, navigate to the folder containing these scripts and double\-click on [emag.prj](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=MathWorks-Teaching-Resources/Electricity-Magnetism&project=emag.prj&file=README.mlx). It will add the appropriate files to your MATLAB path and open an app that asks you where you would like to start. 


Ensure you have all the required products ([listed below](#H_E850B4FF)) installed. If you need to include a product, add it using the Add\-On Explorer. To install an add\-on, go to the **Home** tab and select  <img src="Images/image_2.png" width="16" alt="image_2.png"> **Add-Ons** > **Get Add-Ons**.
